# database-replicator
replicate selective/complete database from remote machine to another database on local machine with HTML application User Interface

Steps: -

1. Most of the files have (file location) address associated with other files in this project.
So make sure you change these addresses according to the directory in which you placed the project folder

2.Either do not change the file names or if u change them then reflect the same changes in the file addresses also which is present in most of the files.

3.You need a database server such as mysql server for storing and accessing database. (I used xampp's phpmyadmin)

4.Main application to start with is App.hta.

All the Best!
